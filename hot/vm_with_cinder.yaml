description: >
  A HOT template that holds a VM instance with an attached
  Cinder volume.  The VM does nothing, it is only created.

parameters:
  key_name:
    type: string
    description: Name of an existing key pair to use for the instance
    constraints:
      - custom_constraint: nova.keypair
        description: Must name a public key (pair) known to Nova
  flavor:
    type: string
    description: Flavor for the instance to be created
    default: m1.small
    constraints:
      - custom_constraint: nova.flavor
        description: Must be a flavor known to Nova
  image:
    type: string
    description: >
      Name or ID of the image to use for the instance.
      You can get the default from
      http://cloud.fedoraproject.org/fedora-20.x86_64.qcow2
      There is also
      http://cloud.fedoraproject.org/fedora-20.i386.qcow2
      Any image should work since this template
      does not ask the VM to do anything.

        description: Must identify an image known to Glance
  network:
